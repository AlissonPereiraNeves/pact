Could not find a provider state named "<%= name %>" for <%= consumer %>.
Have you required the provider states file for this consumer in your pact_helper.rb?
If you have not yet defined a provider state for "<%= name %>", here is a template:

Pact.provider_states_for "<%= consumer %>" do
  provider_state "<%= name %>" do
    set_up do
      # Your set up code goes here
    end
  end
end
