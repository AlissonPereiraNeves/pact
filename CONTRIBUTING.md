If you would like to implement pact in another language, please check out the [Pact specification](https://github.com/bethesque/pact-specification) and have a chat to one of us on the [pact-dev Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pact-dev). The vision is to have a compatible pact implementation in all the commonly used languages, your help would be greatly appreciated!
